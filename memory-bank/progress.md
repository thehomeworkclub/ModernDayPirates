# Development Progress

## Completed Features

### VR Rifle System
- ✓ Implemented base rifle framework with inheritance pattern
- ✓ Created physical reloading system with magazine detachment/reattachment
- ✓ Developed M16A1 rifle with proper magazine positioning
- ✓ Developed AK-74 rifle with proper magazine positioning
- ✓ Implemented single bullet firing system (overriding base gun behavior)
- ✓ Added subtle muzzle flash effects
- ✓ Created recoil animations with weapon-specific parameters
- ✓ Integrated haptic feedback for controllers
- ✓ Fixed detachment/reattachment issues with improved state management
- ✓ Optimized detection thresholds for better VR gunstock compatibility
- ✓ Documented rifle system thoroughly in VR_RIFLE_SYSTEM.md

### 3D Campaign Menu
- ✓ Implemented VR laser pointer interaction system
- ✓ Created button collision and interaction system
- ✓ Added campaign selection mechanics
- ✓ Integrated sprite sheet animation system
- ✓ Set up difficulty indicators and flags
- ✓ Added haptic feedback for button presses
- ✓ Implemented proper error handling and debug logs
- ✓ Disabled map area clicking for cleaner interaction
- ✓ Material handling for laser beams with proper transparency
- ✓ Color change feedback for button hovering

### Core Systems
- ✓ VR environment setup
- ✓ XR controller configuration
- ✓ Game state management
- ✓ Scene transitions

## In Progress
- Rifle system expansion with 5 additional rifles (inheritance-based)
- Integration of new game levels from temp-game/
- Enemy system integration
- Wave-based spawning system implementation

### Asset Integration
- ✓ Imported cargo ship meshes and textures from temp-game/Cargo_Ships/
- ✓ Imported rifle models from assets/guns_hands/VRFPS_Kit/Models/Weapons/

## To Do
- Create 5 additional rifle implementations with specific attributes:
  - SCAR-L (Tactical rifle with balanced stats)
  - HK416 (High-precision rifle with better accuracy)
  - MP5 (Submachine gun with faster fire rate but lower damage)
  - Mosin Nagant (Bolt-action rifle with high damage but slow fire rate)
  - One more rifle type to be determined
- Adapt player character for VR interaction
- Integrate enemy AI systems:
  - Melee enemy behavior
  - Ranged enemy attacks
  - Boss fight mechanics
  - Summoner abilities
- Implement wave spawning in VR space
- Connect level progression with campaign menu
- Weapon system integration with rifle framework
- Ship damage mechanics
- Save/load system
- Leader boards
- Tutorial system
- Audio system implementation
- Particle effects and visual polish
- Performance optimization

## Technical Achievements
- Successfully implemented proper VR interaction patterns
- Created robust button system with visual and haptic feedback
- Efficient collision detection and handling
- Clean separation of concerns in menu system
- Detailed debug logging for troubleshooting
- Reliable physical reloading system for VR gunstock usage
- Optimized detection thresholds for VR motion

## Next Steps
1. Create the 5 additional rifle implementations
2. Ensure proper magazine positioning for each new gun
3. Balance weapon attributes (damage, fire rate, accuracy, recoil)
4. Adapt enemy systems for VR combat
5. Implement wave spawning mechanics
6. Connect rifle system with enemy damage system

## Known Issues
- None currently reported for menu or rifle systems
