# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
We have successfully implemented a comprehensive VR weapons system with physical reloading mechanics optimized for use with a gunstock. The system allows for realistic magazine removal and insertion using physical hand movements. Seven different weapon models are now implemented with proper magazines, muzzle flashes, and recoil animations.

We have also implemented boat-based gameplay with enemy ships that shoot bombs at the player's boat. The health system shows damage on both the player UI and directly on the gun as a row of 10 hearts.

The completed weapon arsenal includes:
1. M16A1 (Assault rifle - default)
2. AK-74 (Assault rifle)
3. SCAR-L (Tactical rifle with balanced stats)
4. HK416 (High-precision rifle with better accuracy)
5. MP5 (Submachine gun with faster fire rate but lower damage)
6. Mosin Nagant (Bolt-action rifle with high damage but slow fire rate)
7. Model 1897 (Shotgun with pellet spread and 2-shell magazine)

Each weapon has unique handling characteristics, animations, and mechanics while maintaining a consistent reloading system.

Key implementation details:
- Base rifle functionality in BaseRifleGun.gd for inheritance
- Physical reloading using controller position tracking
- Properly scaled magazines with scale factor 15
- Generous detection margins for easier VR interaction:
  - Detachment threshold: 0.3 meters perpendicular distance
  - Reattachment detection radius: 0.2 meters from magazine well
- Simplified two-state system (ATTACHED_TO_GUN and DETACHED)
- Visual toggling of magazines with duplicated models for hand attachment

## VR Positioning Reference
- Campaign menu VR position: Vector3(10.954, -7.596, 4.236)
- Level1 XROrigin3D editor position: Vector3(2.45716, 16.3239, 85.035)
- Camera height: 1.8
- Ray length: 10.0
- Button press distance: 0.03

## Performance Optimizations
VR performance considerations remain important, especially as we add more weapon models:

1. Runtime optimizations:
   - Disabled expensive rendering features (SDFGI, SSIL)
   - Reduced shadow quality and draw distance
   - Implemented LOD (Level of Detail) support
   - Optimized mesh instance properties

2. Resource optimization tools:
   - performance_optimizer.gd for runtime scene optimization
   - optimize_resources.gd for editor-time asset optimization

3. Key performance settings:
   - Target FPS: 90 (VR standard)
   - Physics tick rate: 60
   - Texture size limit: 1024px

## Recently Completed
1. Wave Spawning System Improvements
   - Fixed wave progression and enemy spawning mechanics
   - Implemented proper 5-wave rounds with 2 enemies per wave
   - Fixed issue where killing one enemy would remove all enemies
   - Fixed issue where rounds were ending prematurely after 1 wave
   - Improved wave completion detection with better tracking
   - Added reliable force-check mechanism for wave transitions
   - Removed double-counting of enemy kills in GameManager
   - Fixed enemy count tracking with explicit remove_from_tracking system

2. Enemy Weapons and Health System Improvements
   - Upgraded enemy bullets to use M16A1Bullet.tscn model scaled at 5x
   - Added red coloration to enemy bullets for visual distinction
   - Fixed health system to maintain exactly 10 maximum health
   - Implemented a proper death sequence with dark red fade overlay
   - Added system to restart game at round 1 after player death
   - Fixed bidirectional health synchronization between boat and gun display
   - Improved bomb collision detection with player boat

3. VR Weapons System Expansion
   - Added 5 new weapon types with diverse characteristics:
     - SCAR-L: Tactical rifle with balanced stats (damage: 3, accuracy: 0.92)
     - HK416: High-precision rifle (damage: 3, accuracy: 0.95, low recoil: 0.15)
     - MP5: Submachine gun (damage: 1, fast fire rate: 0.08, lower accuracy: 0.85)
     - Mosin Nagant: Bolt-action rifle (high damage: 8, excellent accuracy: 0.98, 5-round magazine)
     - Model 1897: Shotgun (fires 8 pellets per shot, spread pattern, 2-shell magazine)
   - Implemented weapon switching via keyboard number keys (1-7) for debugging
   - Fixed ghost magazine issue when switching weapons
   - Added proper textured models for all weapons with appropriate UIDs

2. VR Rifle System Core
   - Physical reloading with magazine detachment/reattachment
   - Realistic weapon models and magazines
   - Single bullet firing system that overrides base gun system
   - Subtle muzzle flash effects
   - Haptic feedback on both controllers
   - Recoil animations
   - Support for automatic and semi-automatic firing modes
   - Bolt-action mechanism for Mosin Nagant
   - Pellet spread system for shotgun

3. Core System Integration
   - XR controller integration for interaction
   - Ray casting for precise VR interaction
   - Animation system for visual feedback
   - Haptic feedback for tactile confirmation

## Next Steps
1. Gameplay Integration:
   - Connect rifle system with enemy damage system
   - Implement ammo pickup/management
   - Balance gameplay around different weapon types
   - Add visual effects for different weapon types (unique muzzle flashes, etc.)
   - Implement weapon unlocking/progression system
   - Add haptic feedback variation for different weapons

2. Quality of Life Improvements:
   - Implement weapon selection via VR controllers (not just keyboard)
   - Add visual indicator for current selected weapon
   - Create weapon rack for in-game selection
   - Refine magazine positioning for optimal usability

## Active Considerations
- Maintain consistent interaction patterns across all rifle types
- Keep performance optimization in mind - monitor frame rate with multiple weapons
- Ensure magazine models are properly positioned for each new rifle
- Balance reload difficulty across different weapon types
- Design weapon attributes to encourage use of different rifles

## Documentation Status
- Rifle system fully documented in VR_RIFLE_SYSTEM.md
- Magazine positioning documented in .clinerules
- Interaction patterns established
- Debug logging implemented
