# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
The VR campaign menu system is now complete with all core functionality implemented and working as expected. The menu provides a solid foundation for the rest of the game's VR interaction systems.

## Recently Completed
1. VR Menu System
- Laser pointer interaction
- Button collision and feedback
- Campaign selection
- Difficulty indicators
- Map display system
- Material handling for visual feedback
- Disabled map clicking for cleaner UX

2. Core Systems
- VR environment initialization
- Controller setup and interaction
- Scene management
- Game state handling

## Current Development Stage
With the menu system complete, we're ready to move on to implementing the core gameplay systems:
1. Shop functionality
2. Campaign gameplay mechanics
3. Enemy spawning system
4. Weapon systems

## Technical Foundation
- OpenXR integration is working properly
- VR interaction patterns are established
- Collision system is well-tested
- Debug systems are in place
- Scene transitions are handled

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of shop system:
   - Item display
   - Purchase mechanics
   - Inventory management
   - Currency system

2. Start developing gameplay mechanics:
   - Ship controls
   - Combat systems
   - Enemy behavior
   - Scoring system

## Active Considerations
- Maintain consistent VR interaction patterns established in menu
- Keep performance optimization in mind for future scaling
- Continue using established debug logging patterns
- Follow same code organization structure

## Documentation Status
- Menu system fully documented
- Debug outputs implemented
- Code comments up to date
- Progress tracking current
